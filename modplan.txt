phase I
pseudoephedrine + iodine + red phosphorus + water in heated basin = white m fluid
pour white m fluid over tray, press 2x = cracked white m sheet
mech craft for dust and tray back
iodine = heated mix water to get brine, mix brine
red phosphorus = grind limestone to get white phosphate, heated mix to get red phosphorus
pseudoephedrine milled from ephedra crop

phase II
methylamine = mix ammonia + methanol with aluminosilicate catalyst
methanol = coal/charcoal + hydrogen with copper-zinc catalyst
heated mix water with copper-zinc catalyst to produce hydrogen and oxygen
copper-zinc catalyst = crushed copper + crushed zinc
mix beetroot/potatoes = nitrogen
heated mix nitrogen = ammonia
crush clay for 10% aluminosilicate bit 50% clay, 32 aluminosilicate bits = aluminosilicate catalyst
cyanide = crush apples
phenylacetic acid = cyanide mixed with water, water not consumed
acetic anhydride = sugar + oxygen
phenylacetone = acetic anhydride + phenylacetic acid
blue m fluid = phenylacetone + methlymine
pour blue m fluid over tray, press 4x = cracked blue m sheet
press for dust and tray back

misc
mech craft stick + red phosphorus = 4 matches
white phosphorus can replace gunpowder in tnt
tray = 3 forge:plates/iron
